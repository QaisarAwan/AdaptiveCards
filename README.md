# Adaptive Cards

Different samples about using Adaptive Cards by Microsoft and the Timeline feature in Windows 10:

* A WPF app packaged with the Desktop Bridge
* A UWP app
* A website
* A chat bot based on the Microsoft Bot Framework
* An Azure Function which parses a RSS feed and returns the JSON payload of an Adaptive Card

The samples are a companion for the following post published on the Windows AppConsult blog: <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appconsult/2018/03/13/adaptive-cards-desktop-bridge-and-timeline-in-windows-10/>
